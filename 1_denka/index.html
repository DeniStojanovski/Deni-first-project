            <p>Religion is usually defined as a social-cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, morals,
                beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally
                relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements; however, there is no
                scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion.
                Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the divine, sacred
                things, faith, a supernatural being or supernatural beings or "some sort of ultimacy and
                transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life". Religious practices may
                include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration (of deities and/or saints), sacrifices, festivals,
                feasts, trances, initiations, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, prayer, music, art,
                dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture. Religions have sacred histories and
                narratives, which may be preserved in sacred scriptures, and symbols and holy places, that aim mostly to
                give a meaning to life. Religions may contain symbolic stories, which are sometimes said by followers to
                be true, that may also attempt to explain the origin of life, the universe, and other phenomena.
                Traditionally, faith, in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs.
                There are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide. About 84% of the world's population is
                affiliated with Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, or some form of folk religion. The
                religiously unaffiliated demographic includes those who do not identify with any particular religion,
                atheists, and agnostics. But many of the religiously unaffiliated still have various religious
                beliefs. A portion of the population mostly located in Africa and Asia are members of new religious
                movements.
                The study of religion comprises a wide variety of academic disciplines, including theology, philosophy
                of religion, comparative religion, and social scientific studies. Theories of religion offer various
                explanations for the origins and workings of religion, including the ontological foundations of
                religious being and belief.</p>

            <p>If the grave is in a cemetery on the property of a church or other religious organization (part of, or
                called, a churchyard), gravediggers may be members of the decedent's family or volunteer parishioners.
                Digging graves has also been one of the traditional duties of a church's sexton. In municipal and
                privately owned cemeteries, gravediggers may be low-paid, unskilled and temporary labourers, or they may
                be well-paid, trained and professional careerists, as their duties may include landscaping tasks and
                courteous interactions with mourners and other visitors. In some countries, gravedigging may be done by
                landscaping workers for the local council or local authority.

                A gravedigger implements a variety of tools to accomplish his primary task. A template, in the form of a
                wooden frame built to prescribed specifications, is often placed on the ground over the intended grave.
                The gravedigger may use a sod-cutter or spade to cut the outline of the grave and remove the top layer
                of sod. Digging the grave by hand usually requires shovels, picks, mattocks and/or other tools.
                Cemeteries in industrialized countries may keep a backhoe loader and other heavy equipment, which
                greatly increases the efficiency of gravedigging.

                Typically, gravediggers - at least in most Western countries - will use a wooden box to put the soil in.
                This box consists of several large pieces of wood that fit together, and the box is assembled next to
                the grave. Once the grave has been dug and the soil from the grave has been placed in the box, the box
                will usually be covered with a piece of tarpaulin or similar material. The soil will then remain in the
                box until the day of the back-fill, when the funeral takes place and the soil is emptied back into the
                grave after the coffin has been lowered, after which the box is disassembled. Due to the close proximity
                of graves in cemeteries (4 feet (1.20 m) between the centre of each headstone is common in modern UK
                cemeteries), the wooden box is often placed in front of one or more other graves, and is seen as a
                nuisance to those wishing to visit graves adjacent to a grave that is due to be filled.

                Although the expression "six feet under" refers to the depth at which people were traditionally buried,
                at least in the UK, the minimum legal depth for a new grave is seven feet (2.10 m).
                This allows a maximum of three coffins to be buried in the same grave, typically family members of the
                deceased who are buried at a later date - which is known as a re-open. Gravediggers must take care to
                get the proportions of a grave right, as the hole needs to be big enough for the coffin to be lowered
                in. Additionally, shoring is often used to stop a grave from collapsing. Gravediggers must make sure
                that the coffin can fit through the shoring. Additionally, on the day of the back-fill and for the
                funeral service, typically artificial turf will be placed around the grave whilst the coffin is being
                lowered.

                In many cultures throughout history, gravediggers have been highly marginalized by their societies. In
                the traditional caste system of India, cemetery work has been the responsibility of the lowest castes,
                considered "unclean" or "untouchable" for their association with death.</p>

            <p>A cemetery, burial ground, gravesite or graveyard is a place where the remains of dead people are buried
                or otherwise interred. The word cemetery (from Greek κοιμητήριον, "sleeping place") implies that
                the land is specifically designated as a burial ground and originally applied to the Roman catacombs.
                The term graveyard is often used interchangeably with cemetery, but a graveyard primarily refers to a
                burial ground within a churchyard.
                The intact or cremated remains of people may be interred in a grave, commonly referred to as burial, or
                in a tomb, an "above-ground grave" (resembling a sarcophagus), a mausoleum, columbarium, niche, or other
                edifice. In Western cultures, funeral ceremonies are often observed in cemeteries. These ceremonies or
                rites of passage differ according to cultural practices and religious beliefs. Modern cemeteries often
                include crematoria, and some grounds previously used for both, continue as crematoria as a principal use
                long after the interment areas have been filled.</p>

            <p>Revelation 21:8
                But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice
                magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This
                is the second death.”

                Matthew 25:46
                “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”

                Psalms 9:17
                The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God.

                Thessalonians 1:9
                They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from
                the glory of his might

                Matthew 13:50
                ... and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

                Acts 2:27
                because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, you will not let your holy one see decay.

                Mark 9:43
                If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two
                hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.

                Jude 1:7
                In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality
                and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.

                Proverbs 15:24
                The path of life leads upward for the prudent to keep them from going down to the realm of the dead.

                Proverbs 23:14
                Punish them with the rod and save them from death.

                Matthew 13:42
                They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

                Matthew 25:41
                “Then he will say to those on his left, Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire
                prepared for the devil and his angels.

                Revelation 19:20
                But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf.
                With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.
                The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.

                Proverbs 15:11
                Death and Destruction lie open before the LORD— how much more do human hearts!

                Matthew 16:19
                I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will bebound in heaven,
                and whatever you loose on earth will beloosed in heaven.”

                Peter 2:4
                For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of
                darkness to be held for judgment;

                Revelation 20:13-14
                The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and
                each person was judged according to what they had done.
                Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.

                Matthew 10:28
                Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who
                can destroy both soul and body in hell.

                Ezekiel 18:20
                The one who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the
                parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and
                the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them.</p>
